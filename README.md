# üöÄ Green Spark Submission

## Project Title
Carbon Diet Platform

## Problem Statement Addressed
Current tools are too individual-focused ‚Äî most carbon trackers focus only on personal habits, which can feel isolating or boring.

Lack of motivation ‚Äî there‚Äôs no real incentive to keep using them.

Low community involvement ‚Äî people don‚Äôt feel part of a bigger movement.

## Project Overview
CarbonQuest is a gamified sustainability platform that turns eco-friendly habits into a fun community competition. Users join teams (like neighborhoods or schools), log daily green actions‚Äîlike taking public transport or reducing water use‚Äîand earn "Green Credits." These points fuel team leaderboards and can be redeemed for real rewards from local businesses. The app includes daily challenges, progress tracking, and QR-based reward claims. By combining social motivation, friendly competition, and real-world impact, CarbonQuest makes living sustainably fun, rewarding, and community-driven
